While completing the final lessons on React and Redux, I thought, what kind of project do I want to create for my last and final project as a Flatiron Student? I was looking to be inspired by a concept and to create something different than my previous applications. I started gathering information on third party API's and watching different Flatiron lecture videos and was still stumped as to what I wanted to create. The Flatiron lecture videos are a great resource that I have found extremely helpful during my time as an online student. If there was ever a concept I was struggling with - I would search a variety of videos as well as re-read the lessons and would even watch some videos multiple times and take notes alongside each iteration. 

It was after watching a React Weather App video I started gaining some traction on an application idea. I liked the idea of using a science-based API to create a new application. That night as I was reading (an unrelated tech book), NASA popped into my head and I thought, there must be some interesting APIs in which NASA has created. Isn't it always an unrelated activity to distract yourself when you come up with the best ideas? My search revealed much more than what I was expecting - not only does NASA have an amazing Astronomy Picture of the Day API, but they offer a wide range of API's varying from satellite imagery to asteroid locations. Here is a link to the entire listing - [NASA API LISTING](https://api.nasa.gov/index.htmlp://)

As I read about the different APIs offered by NASA I settled on the APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day). I liked how a user could visit the application every day and a new photo or video would appear with a title, date, and explanation written by a professional astronomer. Photos and videos range from celestial wonders to the most recent Mars landing.  I started to create my react front end and as I made progress I continued to be awe-inspired by the photos and written explanations. I wanted a way for users who visited the application to be able to save pertinent information about the daily APOD. Some photos were taken from a remote part of Earth and some detailed a location light years away. My application idea started to take shape in the form of an AstroNote. A user has the ability to create a note (or two) detailing any information regarding an astronomy image or video. The AstroNotes are saved in the form of a 400x400px card and can be re-read by anyone - furthering any one's own knowledge and inspiration on the topic. 

I found so many of the NASA API's to be captivating and started to incorporate an additional feature called EPIC DSCOVR's Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera.  Although this feature isn't available to my application today - I foresee adding it in the future as an additional source of awe and inspiration for users. 

In addition to the third party API, I was looking to challenge myself with creating an intuitive UI design with strong aesthetics.  I found a package called Material Design Bootstrap React (MDB React) and was instantly immersed in creating something beautiful. I am extremely passionate about visual and creative design and it's a subject I am excited to continue learning about.
