So I'm not sure, but writing a new blog post during inclement weather may become a trend here.  Currently, it appears that I'm trapped in a snow globe with snow flurries blowing in every direction.  Winter Storm Skylar is the third nor'easter to hit New England since March 2nd and it appears that Mother Nature has decided that March is the month of nor'easters.  While I do enjoy the snow, it also has me daydreaming of warmer climates.

*I am writing this before I either lose power or before too much snow piles on the internet satellite dish*

In the curriculum, I am currently gearing up to plan my CLI project.  After attending a CLI Study group last night as an introduction to the requirements, it became more clear to me I needed to start planning and gathering ideas while progressing in Object Oriented Ruby. This morning I attended another CLI Study Group (s/o to Corinna) where there was a walkthrough of an example. I found this study group to be extremely helpful in coming up with ideas for what I want to build - all ideas centered around traveling and warmer weather. Shocking, I know - what else would I be thinking of during a blizzard. 

In addition, I found it helpful to listen to other student questions who appear to have more of the project completed. Going over the example of the project gave me an immediate feeling of excitement towards my own project and what I will build in the upcoming weeks.  

In conclusion - I am going to publish this before Skylar decides it's time to go. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for my next post on my CLI project.
