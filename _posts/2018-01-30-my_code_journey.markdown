As I stare out the window watching the snowflakes dissolve into the ocean; I figure, what better time to start my blog and tell you more about the winding journey that led me to learn how to code.

Hey! My name is Dee Race, and I am learning to code through Flatiron School’s Full Stack Web Development program in Maine. Last year I was living in Boston (#GoPats) and was in a creative career doing marketing and WordPress website management. As the days turned into weeks I started to reflect on the different aspects of my job and where I could go in my career. As I dove deeper into WordPress I found myself wanting to know more about how this site actually worked. Each day presented a new issue, and I felt excited and curious to solve it. There was a breakthrough one day where I was editing in HTML and didn’t even realize it. After that day at work, I took the T back to my apartment and I started researching about what it’s like to learn how to code. I felt empowered when I would solve a problem at work only to realize later that I was learning the fundamentals of coding.

So down the rabbit hole, I went. I subscribed and bookmarked about every resource I could find at the time (to this day I still encounter new resources) and started to learn more and create a plan. I found Kode With Klossy and saw that Flatiron School was a partner. I read about the amazing journeys of former students and couldn’t help but envision myself as one of those success stories. I found myself connecting with the stories of creative individuals learning to code because of my creative background. I graduated from the University of Delaware with a BFA in 3 years after transferring from a school in Florida. Weeks after graduating from school I went to an Artist Residency in Michigan for two weeks, planned an international trip with my best friend. Did an internship at Shands Hospital learning about Arts in Medicine, came back to New England where I designed my studio and moved to Boston. I am a creative, an explorer, and a curious being… all those things led me to find coding and I am thankful. And when it comes down to it, creating and constructing an art project is the same as creating and building a website or app. Brainstorming, planning, building, and re-building all come together for an end product. And I genuinely enjoy doing all of that. Whether that be a canvas for a painting, mixing paint colors, making coasters, building a complex geometric wooden design or writing a program on the computer.

Over the summer I was taking Flatiron’s free JavaScript course and received an email about the TechConnect Scholarship. I decided it was the right time to apply to the Full Stack Web Development program in addition to the scholarship. I was thrilled when I received the acceptance email AND scholarship!

Fast forward to today, here writing my first blog post. The journey to get to this place hasn’t been easy, but I continue to persevere because this is equally as hard as it is rewarding. So follow along on my journey to code in Midcoast Maine!
